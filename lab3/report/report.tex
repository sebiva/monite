\section{Part I}
For this assignment, we have chosen the package ‘haskeline’. Haskeline is used
to provide a more advanced means of getting input from the user than using the
standard ‘getLine’ function in Haskell. It provides functionality similar to
that of the GNU readline library for C, used in many linux applications. We
think haskeline is an interesting package as it provides a very easy way of
getting a nice input interface for your haskell command line applications.

Our idea is to implement a simple shell in haskell using this library along with
the process library to pass on the calls to the system binaries. In order to
make it a bit more interesting, we thought it would be fun to add some basic
scripting functionality to the shell (as in bash/zsh). Since the project is so
limited, this scripting language would be very limited. The things we have
planned are:

Variables using let expressions for example:
\begin{verbatim}
  let $x = ls -la in x | wc; cd ..; x
\end{verbatim}

Which would be equivalent to:

\begin{verbatim}
  ls -la | wc; cd ..; ls -la
\end{verbatim}

Not only should it be possible to have variables in scope for the coming
command, but also for the whole session:

\begin{verbatim}
  let $x = hello; echo $x
\end{verbatim}

List comprehensions over lists of output values from another command:

\begin{verbatim}
  [ echo $x | $x <- ls]
\end{verbatim}

Which would correspond to (in zsh):

\begin{verbatim}
  for $f in $(ls); do echo $f; done
\end{verbatim}

Functions (this is by far the hardest part, and may not be feasible for such a small project):

\begin{verbatim}
  let f n = n + 1 in echo (f 0)
\end{verbatim}

Which would be interpreted / evaluated as:

\begin{verbatim}
  echo 1
\end{verbatim}

In order to write such a shell application, we would need to write a parser for
the user input. Luckily, the package bnfc makes it easy to generate a parser
automatically from a specified grammar, and by having a very restricted set of
features it should not be too hard to write those rules.

With a finished parser, the challenge will be to put it all together, i.e.,
handling user input via haskeline, parsing (and interpreting) the scripting
language via the bnfc generated parser, and handling system binary execution via
the process library. Our haskell shell will also need to handle the state of the
shell, that is, the current path and variables. One possible extension would be
to implement even more advanced shell functionality such as job control (way out
of scope for this project, but it would be cool to have).


We believe this project would cover the course goals in the following ways:

\textbf{DSLs}: Both bnfc and haskeline are DSLs, so working with them will require
understanding how they work. Our own scripting language will be a DSL in itself,
and by implementing it, we will need to handle both the concrete and abstract
syntax of our language, as well as the semantics when evaluating it.

\textbf{Types}: Writing the code for this project will inevitably include writing our own
types, and since our shell will no doubt have to be at least in the IO monad
(and the State monad), we will use monad transformers to construct it, also, the
abstract syntax will be an algebraic datatype.  The haskeline library uses quite
a big stack of monad transformers (mostly ReaderT). If functions are to be
implemented in our shell language, we might need to use a GADT to model the
expressions.

\textbf{Spec / Testing}: Ideally, we would like to also create  a proper testsuite
(preferably using quickCheck) for our program, but as time will be very limited,
this will only be done if there is time left. Since the program will be mostly
monadic, proving properties might be hard.

We realise that this might be an ambitious undertaking, and we have consulted
one of the TAs about the project. The recommendation was to focus on the
haskeline library, and instead question it’s implementation choices, and try to
make suggestions on how to improve upon them. However, we feel that writing a
simple shell could be a really interesting project, and we would like to give it
a try, but, should we realise early that this is not feasible within the limited
time-frame of this course, we will instead go with the TAs recommendation and
focus on the haskeline library itself.
